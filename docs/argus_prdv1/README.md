## Locked decisions

These are committed and do not need to be re-litigated when reading the modules. The reasoning behind each is in the relevant module.

- **Blockchain:** Hedera single-chain for v1; multi-chain (Ethereum L2 + Solana via Corda Protocol) post-scale
- **Token standards:** ERC-3643 on HSCS for securities; HTS native for collectibles and stablecoin operations
- **Wallet infrastructure:** Native build on Hedera SDKs (Go server-side, Swift on iOS, Kotlin on Android). Keys in Apple Secure Enclave / Android Keystore; server-side passkey-encrypted backup for recovery. Vendor key-custody layer (Fireblocks Dynamic or equivalent) re-evaluated for v2 if institutional partners require it.
- **Stablecoin:** USDC primary; USDT secondary
- **Backend language:** Go
- **Orchestration:** Temporal for money-movement workflows; Conductor OSS for agent workflows
- **Mobile:** Native Swift (iOS) and Kotlin (Android) — both at launch
- **Web:** Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Auth:** Passkey-first on mobile and web; SMS OTP as constrained recovery channel
- **Launch geography:** US and international (Nigeria, Philippines, Brazil priority) in parallel
- **Marketplace surfaces:** Securities-style RWAs + physical collectibles + Web3-native gaming assets
- **KYC model:** Tiered identity ladder; users tier up only when a feature gate requires it

## Open decisions (see Module 11)

- Partner bank selection (Column vs Lead vs Cross River)
- First-party tokenization partner (Securitize vs Tokeny vs both)
- Capital plan / team sizing for parallel US + international launch
- Brand and product name confirmation (is "Argus Financial Partners" final?)
- Specific international corridors for v1 (which 3 of: Nigeria, Philippines, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico)

## Conventions used in this PRD

- **Requirements** are tagged with `[REQ-XXX]` identifiers for cross-referencing.
- **Out-of-scope** items are called out explicitly so they don't creep into v1.
- **Open questions** are flagged `[Q]` and rolled up in Module 11.
- All monetary amounts are stored as **integer base units** (cents for fiat, smallest denomination for tokens). No floats anywhere in the system.
- "v1" means initial public launch. "v2" means first major iteration after launch (~6 months post-v1). "v3" means second iteration (~12 months post-v1).
