## Risk register

Material risks to the program with current mitigation posture. Risks are categorized:

- **CRITICAL** — could kill the company
- **HIGH** — could materially delay or de-scope v1
- **MEDIUM** — manageable but worth active monitoring
- **LOW** — known but acceptable

### Regulatory and compliance risks

| Risk | Category | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Stablecoin regulation reverses GENIUS Act framework | CRITICAL | Diversify across stablecoin issuers (USDC primary, USDT secondary); ability to operate in USDC-pegged TradFi mode if needed |
| US enforcement action against tokenized RWAs we list | HIGH | Work with established issuers (Securitize, Ondo); legal review of every listing; conservative jurisdiction stance (no NY in v1) |
| State MTL application denied or delayed | HIGH | Sponsor-bank model for v1 (Column or partner provides coverage); MTLs in parallel |
| Partner bank changes posture on crypto-adjacent business | HIGH | Backup partner bank under contract; ability to fail over within ~30 days |
| International jurisdiction policy reversal (Nigeria precedent) | HIGH | USDC-only fallback mode per corridor; diversified corridor portfolio |
| SAR backlog or quality issues trigger regulator interest | HIGH | Agent-assisted drafting (Module 08); senior compliance officer review of all filings; clear SLA |
| Travel Rule non-compliance discovered post-launch | MEDIUM | Vendor (Notabene/Sumsub) is industry standard; explicit Travel Rule workflow in payments service |

### Technical and security risks

| Risk | Category | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Hedera network material outage | HIGH | Transaction queue + degraded mode in service layer; visible status to users; v2 multi-chain reduces this risk substantially |
| Native wallet build introduces critical security bug | CRITICAL | Mandatory 2-round external security audit before Phase 2; bug bounty program live at beta; conservative rollout (alpha → 1% beta → full beta); 24-hour wallet circuit breaker; senior security engineer hire in Phase 0; crime/cyber insurance with explicit native-wallet coverage |
| Native wallet build slips beyond Phase 1 audit gate | HIGH | 3-engineer team committed full-time in Phase 0; weekly progress reviews; fallback option to integrate Fireblocks Dynamic for v1 retains ~6 week swap-in path if native build fails audit |
| Hedera SDK or platform secure-element regression breaks signing | HIGH | Version pinning, comprehensive integration test suite, ability to roll forward quickly; relationship with Hedera Foundation for early-warning on breaking changes |
| Recovery flow fails to unlock legitimate user accounts | HIGH | Multiple recovery paths (passkey sync, encrypted backup, manual escalation); user-configurable secondary factors; clear support escalation; agent-assisted manual recovery (Module 08) |
| USDC depeg or Circle issue | HIGH | Chainlink PoR monitoring + circuit breaker; user notifications; USDT as alternative; insurance coverage |
| Smart contract exploit in our deployed contracts | CRITICAL | Multiple audits before deploy; bug bounty program; upgrade path via timelock + multisig; insurance |
| Smart contract exploit in third-party contracts we integrate with | HIGH | DD before integration; limit user exposure per integration; ability to pause specific integrations |
| Key compromise (paymaster or compliance multisig) | CRITICAL | Keys in CloudHSM; multisig requires multiple parties; rotation procedures; alerting |
| DDoS / API abuse attack | MEDIUM | Cloudflare + AWS WAF; rate limiting throughout; capacity to scale during attack |
| Data breach exposing user PII | CRITICAL | Field-level encryption; least-privilege access; HSM-stored keys; SOC 2 / pen test |

### Operational and execution risks

| Risk | Category | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Agent operations don't meet quality bar required for financial product | HIGH | Conservative supervision tiers in v1; ramp auto-approval only with eval data; humans always in loop for material decisions |
| Parallel US + international launch overwhelms organization | HIGH | **Mitigated by Q-ROADMAP-001:** US-first launch; international descoped to Phase B; region leads assigned when intl opens |
| Hiring difficulty in compliance + crypto-experienced engineering | MEDIUM | Competitive comp; remote-first; relationships with recruiting firms specializing in fintech |
| Partner bank or corridor partner delivery slips | HIGH | Multiple partners per category; explicit deadlines in contracts; ready to drop a phase if partner can't deliver |
| Marketing/PR misstep around no-KYC tier creates regulatory attention | HIGH | PR strategy approved by legal; consistent messaging that emphasizes regulatory compliance |
| Marketplace listings dry up (issuers don't want to list with us) | HIGH | Multiple issuer partners; ability to list third-party assets where compliance allows; first-party tokenization in v2 as backup |
| Cost overruns force descoping | MEDIUM | Phase gates with go/no-go decisions; agent-operated model keeps OpEx low |

### Strategic and competitive risks

| Risk | Category | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Robinhood or PayPal launches competing tokenization marketplace | HIGH | Move fast (12 months to v1); differentiate on global reach + collectibles + agent ops cost structure; brand on tokenization-first |
| Stablecoin loses mindshare to CBDCs | MEDIUM | CBDCs are years away in major markets; architecture supports adding CBDC rails when they exist |
| Tokenized RWAs remain institutional-only | MEDIUM | Collectibles surface gives us consumer pull independent of RWA adoption rate; gaming surface ditto |
| Regulatory regime favors incumbents (banks, broker-dealers) | MEDIUM | Partner bank model means we benefit from their charter; pursuit of own charter in v3 |

### Brand and reputational risks

| Risk | Category | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Major user loses funds (phishing, social engineering) and it goes viral | HIGH | UX defaults to safe; education at signup; agent-detected suspicious activity warnings; clear policy on user-error losses |
| Marketplace listing turns out to be a scam | HIGH | DD process (Module 08) before listing; ability to delist immediately; insurance for material losses |
| AI agent makes high-profile mistake on customer-facing channel | MEDIUM | Strict supervision tiers in v1; explicit "agent-drafted, human-approved" model for external communications |
| Founder or exec public misstep | MEDIUM | Communications training; spokesperson strategy; clear PR escalation playbook |

## Decisions log

This section will be populated as decisions are made. Each entry includes the decision, who made it, when, and the rationale.

### Locked decisions (committed in prior conversations)

| Decision | Made by | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Blockchain: Hedera for v1 | Founder | Best institutional credibility + EVM compat + protocol-level AA + USD-pegged fees |
| Multi-chain: deferred to post-launch | Founder | Reduces v1 scope; review when scale justifies multi-chain |
| Embedded wallet: native build on Hedera SDKs (Secure Enclave / Keystore + server-side encrypted backup) | Founder + Eng | Maximum control, zero vendor lock-in, lowest per-MAU cost; Hedera's protocol-level account abstraction makes native build materially simpler than equivalent on EVM; institutional-credibility narrative deferred to v2 review point |
| Backend language: Go | Founder | Performance, single language for backend, strong concurrency for the workload |
| Orchestration: Temporal (money) + Conductor OSS (agents) | Founder + Eng | Best-of-both: Temporal for code-first money workflows, Conductor for agent-orchestrated workflows |
| Mobile: native Swift (iOS) + Kotlin (Android) | Founder | Best UX; team can support both |
| Web: Next.js 15 (App Router) | Founder | Modern framework with good DX and SSR |
| Auth: passkey-first with SMS-OTP recovery | Founder | Best modern auth; SMS only as constrained recovery channel |
| Geography: US-first at launch; international Phase B (supersedes prior parallel-launch intent) | Founder | Reduces org/regulatory load; intl corridors after US product-market fit (Q-ROADMAP-001, 2026-06) |
| KYC: tiered ladder with on-demand upgrades; **Tier 1+ required to buy collectibles** (Q-ID-003) | Founder | Maximum onboarding speed; Tier 0 browse-only on Collect; purchase gates per regulatory threshold |
| Marketplace: securities + collectibles + Web3 gaming | Founder | Two-surface approach; collectibles gives consumer pull, securities give AUM |
| Excluded from v1: COD/traditional publisher gaming items | Claude (recommended) | Legally not possible without publisher cooperation |
| Argus Financial Partners CLI: repurposed as internal admin console | Founder | Preserves prior work as ops/compliance tooling |
