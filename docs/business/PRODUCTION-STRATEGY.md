# Production Deployment & Technology Strategy

How to ship Argus Financial Partners to real users cheaply, run it as an AI-operated bank, and harden it into a
fraud-resistant, compliance-ready platform — grounded in what's already built in the repo (Hedera
settlement, the double-entry ledger, DID/VC + OID4VP + MCP, the risk-adaptive onboarding orchestrator,
and the Phase 15 internal-agent-ops design).

> **How to read this.** Recommendations are decisive and tagged **STAGE 0** (lean launch),
> **STAGE 1** (scale), or **STAGE 2** (licensed) so the tech rollout lines up with the three-phase
> compliance ramp in the *Corporate Structure* document. Costs are 2025–2026 planning estimates.

## 1. Cloud — recommendation & cost envelope

**Verdict:** don't put a hyperscaler bill on a pre-revenue product. **Start on a lean managed PaaS,
designed so the Stage-1 move to a single hyperscaler is a deploy-target change, not a rewrite.**

### Stage 0 — lean launch (recommended now)

The app is a stateless Node/TS API + Postgres + a few managed data services. Run it for tens of
dollars a month:

| Concern | Pick | Why / cost |
|---|---|---|
| API (Node/Express/TS) | **Render** or **Fly.io** | Git-push deploys, autoscale-to-cheap, private networking. ~$7–25/mo |
| Postgres (prod `DATABASE_URL`) | **Neon** (serverless) or **Supabase** | Branching, scale-to-zero, backups. Free→$20/mo. The code already abstracts SQLite↔Postgres |
| Graph (Identity Vault) | **Neo4j Aura** | Managed, free tier → serverless. $0→$65/mo |
| Cache / queue | **Upstash Redis** | Per-request pricing, ~$0 at low volume |
| Secrets / KMS | **Infisical** or the PaaS secret store → cloud KMS at Stage 1 | Closes the `private_key_hex` gap (see §2) |
| Object storage | **Cloudflare R2** | No egress fees |
| CDN / WAF / DNS | **Cloudflare** | Free WAF + DDoS in front of everything |

**Stage-0 monthly burn: ~$0–150** depending on traffic. That's the whole point — stay near zero
until usage justifies more.

### Stage 1 — consolidate on one hyperscaler (when traffic/compliance demands)

When you need VPC isolation, SOC 2 scope, managed Temporal/Conductor, and a data/ML platform, pick
**one** cloud and commit:

| | **AWS** *(recommended default)* | **GCP** *(pick if ML/graph dominates)* |
|---|---|---|
| Compliance ecosystem | Broadest; most BaaS banks, custodians, KYC vendors run here | Strong, slightly thinner fintech-partner set |
| Managed Postgres | RDS / Aurora | Cloud SQL / AlloyDB (excellent) |
| Containers/orchestration | EKS / ECS Fargate (host Temporal + Conductor) | GKE Autopilot (cheapest managed k8s) |
| ML / fraud | SageMaker | **Vertex AI** (best-in-class, cheaper to start) |
| KMS / HSM | KMS + CloudHSM (for the Hedera paymaster) | Cloud KMS + HSM |
| Cost at scale | Closeable with Savings Plans | Often 10–25% cheaper for data+ML |

**Recommendation:** default to **AWS at Stage 1** — a money business benefits most from AWS's
compliance breadth and the fact that your future partner banks/custodians (Corporate doc, Phase B)
overwhelmingly live there, easing private-link integrations and vendor SOC 2 alignment. Choose **GCP**
only if the fraud-ML and Identity-Vault graph workloads become the cost center — Vertex AI + AlloyDB
are a genuinely better value for that shape. **Do not split across both.**

### Rough cost envelope by scale

| Users | Stage | Monthly infra (ballpark) |
|---|---|---|
| 0–1k | Stage 0 (PaaS) | **$50–250** |
| ~1k–10k | Stage 0→1 | **$300–1,500** |
| ~100k | Stage 1 (AWS/GCP, HA) | **$4k–12k** + data/ML + SOC 2 tooling |

---

## 2. Reference production architecture

The repo is already production-shaped (env-driven config that fails fast on insecure prod settings,
Postgres-or-SQLite via `DATABASE_URL`, append-only ledger/audit triggers, RS256 token factory,
pino + prom-client). Stage-1 wraps it in the standard hardening:

- **Network:** single VPC, private subnets for the DB/graph/Temporal; only the API + Cloudflare are
  public. mTLS / private link to partner-bank and custodian APIs at Phase B.
- **Secrets & keys — close the known gap. ⚠ priority.** The repo documents that Phase 5 stores
  `private_key_hex` server-side (Hedera paymaster + any server-held keys). Move these to **cloud
  KMS/HSM**: envelope-encrypt at rest, never log (pino redaction already strips secrets/tokens/VC/VP),
  and for the Hedera **treasury/paymaster** use an HSM-backed key and a **multisig** so no single
  server compromise drains funds. User keys remain on-device (Secure Enclave) — never regress that.
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions → typecheck + the full vitest suite (131 pass / 3 todo) + the **Playwright
  web E2E** (21 tests) as a required gate → deploy. Migrations run forward-only (already idempotent).
- **Observability (already emitting):** scrape the five prom-client counters (`ledger_post_total`,
  `vp_verify_total{result}`, `mcp_call_total{tool,result}`, `hedera_tx_total{result}`,
  `http_request_duration`) into **Grafana Cloud** (free tier) with alerts; ship pino logs to a
  retained store; add request-id tracing (already threaded).
- **Ledger integrity:** the append-only `ledger_entries`/`ledger_journals`/`audit_logs`/
  `mcp_audit_logs` triggers are the spine — keep them; add **point-in-time-recovery** backups and a
  periodic **balanced-journal invariant** job (the invariant tests already encode the rule).
- **DR/backups:** automated PITR on Postgres + Neo4j, cross-region snapshot copies at Stage 1,
  a documented restore runbook, and quarterly restore drills.
- **Hedera mainnet cutover:** testnet → mainnet with the paymaster HSM/multisig above, plus the
  reconciliation job in §9 (the deferred on-chain↔ledger invariant `n`).

## 3. The automation fabric — agents, MCP & skills to run the bank

This is the differentiator: **an AI-operated bank** where, per the Phase 15 invariant already
designed in `docs/PHASE-15-INTERNAL-AGENT-OPS.md`, **agents decide, deterministic code executes, and
humans gate** anything irreversible. The runtime target is already locked: **Temporal** for
money-critical workflows, **Conductor (OSS)** for agent orchestration. Build the catalog on the
existing seam (`signalService`, `riskOrchestratorService`, `orchestratorModel`, the `agent_runs`
table, `tokenFactory`, `rbac`).

### Two planes

- **External plane (built — Phase 7):** the **MCP server** lets *third-party* AI agents operate on a
  user's behalf under user-granted, VP-verified, scope-intersected, 90-second tokens. Already
  verified end-to-end (scoped-token mint, `SCOPE_DENIED`, balanced-journal transfer,
  `REPLAY_DETECTED`). This is a moat — keep investing here.
- **Internal plane (Phase 15 design → build):** operating agents that run the bank. Per the security
  model, internal skills are **read / recommend / draft only** — no agent gets direct money, state,
  regulator, or infra tools; a deterministic runner executes and a human gates.

### Internal operating-agent catalog

| Agent | Reads | Produces (draft/recommend) | Human gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Onboarding risk** *(exists)* | Signals, device/email/IP/behavior | Tier + risk decision rationale | Auto-approve low risk; human on review-required |
| **Compliance triage** | Audit logs, sanctions hits, txn patterns | SAR/CTR draft, case summary | Compliance officer files |
| **Dispute / chargeback** | Ledger, MCP audit, comms | Resolution recommendation + draft response | Ops approves payout/reversal |
| **Treasury ops** | Balances, on-chain + ledger | Rebalance / paymaster top-up proposal | Human signs the multisig |
| **Reconciliation** | On-chain state vs ledger | Break report + proposed adjusting entry | Human approves any journal |
| **Support copilot** | User state, docs, history | Drafted reply, next-best-action | Agent/human sends |

### Skills (Claude Agent SDK / MCP tools)

Mirror the repo's own dogfooding pattern — it already ships operational skills (`e2e-validator`,
`argus-mcp-test-harness`) that drive the system as a real client. Extend that idea to **ops skills**
(reconciliation report, compliance-case summarizer, incident triage, release validator) so routine
operations and CI are agent-automatable, while every state change still flows through the
deterministic runner with its audit trail.

**Build sequence:** Conductor + the runner contract → onboarding-risk (already real) → reconciliation
& compliance-triage (highest ops leverage) → treasury & dispute → support copilot.

## 4. Identity Vault — a Neo4j graph of users & associations

A property graph is the right model for *relationships*, which is exactly where fraud and identity
truth live. It complements (does not replace) the Postgres ledger.

**Core schema (nodes → relationships):**

```
(:User)-[:OWNS]->(:Device)            (:User)-[:USED]->(:IP)
(:User)-[:HOLDS]->(:Credential{VC})   (:User)-[:FUNDS_WITH]->(:Instrument)
(:User)-[:TRANSACTED_WITH]->(:User)   (:User)-[:NAMES]->(:Beneficiary)
(:User)-[:SHARES]->(:Attribute)       (:Wallet)-[:BOUND_TO]->(:DidKey)
```

**Fed from what already exists** — no new capture layer:
- onboarding **signals** (device fingerprint, email/IP/behavior scores) → device/IP/attribute edges;
- the **ledger** → `TRANSACTED_WITH` edges with weights;
- **MCP audit logs** + VP/holder-binding → wallet↔DID↔credential edges;
- KYC/VC issuance → credential and shared-attribute edges.

**What it unlocks:** synthetic-identity rings (many users → one device/instrument), shared-device and
shared-beneficiary fraud, collusion clusters, and "who is this account actually connected to" for
compliance. Graph features (community, centrality, shortest-path-to-known-bad) feed the fraud model in §5.

**Hosting & guardrails:** **Neo4j Aura** (managed) at Stage 0/1 — don't self-host a database you'll
stake fraud decisions on. Treat it as **PII**: field-level encryption for identifiers, strict access
control, a documented **retention/erasure** policy (GDPR/CCPA right-to-delete must cascade), and
**no raw PII in graph properties** you don't need — store hashes/refs where possible.

---

## 5. Fraud detection — best-of-breed, built on your orchestration engine

The brief is right: **capture every good transaction and signal across the entire user lifecycle**,
and learn normal so anomalies stand out. Build it *on top of the orchestration engine already in the
product*, not as a bolt-on.

**Pipeline:**

1. **Capture (lifecycle-wide):** every onboarding signal, login, device, ledger journal, MCP call,
   marketplace action → an event stream. The append-only audit/ledger tables are the durable spine;
   add a streaming tap (Redis/Kafka-lite) for real-time.
2. **Feature store:** rolling user/device/graph features (velocity, novelty, peer-comparison, the
   Neo4j graph features from §4). Online (low-latency) + offline (training) views.
3. **Scoring (layered):**
   - **Rules** (deterministic, explainable) — velocity caps, sanctions, impossible-travel, the
     existing >$500 MFA gate and per-agent rate limits;
   - **ML anomaly** — unsupervised baseline (isolation forest / autoencoder) for "this is weird,"
     plus a supervised model as labels accumulate;
   - **Graph signals** — proximity to known-bad clusters.
4. **Inline decision:** score **synchronously** on the money path (the ledger/MCP transfer flow
   already mints short-lived tokens and posts balanced journals — the natural choke point). Allow /
   step-up (MFA) / hold / block, each an auditable event.
5. **Feedback loop:** confirmed fraud/good labels flow back into the Identity Vault and retrain — the
   lifecycle-learning the brief describes.

**Build vs buy:** **build the orchestration + rules + graph layer in-house** (it's your moat and it
sits on infra you own), and **buy the model/monitoring layer** if speed matters — **Unit21** or
**Hawk AI** (AML/txn monitoring with case management) or **Sift** (consumer fraud). Recommendation:
in-house rules+graph from day one; add a vendor for AML case management at Phase B when the regulator
expects it; keep the ML model in **Vertex AI/SageMaker** so you own the IP.

---

## 6. Constellation Network "Digital Evidence" — a later-phase evaluation

**What it is:** Constellation's Hypergraph / Digital Evidence lets you notarize data and produce
tamper-evident, independently-verifiable attestations of records and their lineage.

**Where it could fit:** as an *external anchor* over your already-append-only `audit_logs` /
`mcp_audit_logs` / ledger — periodically committing cryptographic proofs so a regulator or
counterparty can verify the audit trail wasn't altered, without trusting your database. It pairs
naturally with the VC/DID evidence the product already issues.

| Pros | Cons |
|---|---|
| Independent, tamper-evident compliance attestations | Adds a vendor + chain dependency |
| Strengthens regulator/auditor trust story | Your DB triggers already give strong internal immutability |
| Aligns with the DID/VC, on-chain ethos | Unproven ROI until a regulator/partner asks for it |

**Recommendation: defer to Phase B/C (post-launch).** Internal append-only triggers + KMS + good
backups are sufficient for launch. Revisit Constellation when a **partner bank, auditor, or
regulator** specifically wants third-party-verifiable evidence — then it's a differentiator, not
overhead. Track it; don't build it into v1.

---

## 7. Mobile — launch iOS first

**Recommendation: iOS first, Android fast-follow.**

- The repo's **SwiftUI wallet (Phase 10)** is already the furthest-along native surface
  (Secure-Enclave P-256 signing key, VC-in-Keychain, `did:key` encoder matching the backend,
  OID4VP/OID4VCI deep links) — less new work to ship.
- **Secure Enclave** is the cleanest expression of the locked non-custodial key model and the
  passkey-first story; Android Keystore is equivalent but you've already invested in the iOS path.
- US-first demographics + higher iOS engagement/ARPU + App Store trust suit a finance app's first
  cohort.
- App Store review for crypto/finance is strict but predictable; lead with the non-custodial,
  no-customer-funds (Phase A) framing.

**Then Android:** the architecture is explicitly "native build, keys in Secure Enclave / **Android
Keystore**" — the second platform is a known, planned port, not a redesign. (Note the documented
gap: the iOS source is reviewed-but-unverified — it needs an Xcode build/sign/submit pass before any
store submission.)

---

## 8. Marketing & go-to-market

**Positioning (and the legal guardrail):** you are an **AI-operated, tokenization-first money app** —
**not** "a bank." Honor the Corporate-doc naming rule: never imply you hold deposits or are chartered.
Lead with the wedge that's actually novel: **AI agents that act on your money under cryptographic,
user-granted permission**, and **tokenized real-world assets** you can hold in a non-custodial wallet.

- **Wedge:** the agent + MCP experience (let your AI assistant check balances, move money, and trade
  under scoped, revocable, audited permission) is a genuinely differentiated story in 2026.
- **Early segment:** crypto-comfortable, AI-forward early adopters and RWA-curious investors —
  not the mass market. Invite-only **waitlist** with referral mechanics to manufacture scarcity and
  control onboarding risk.
- **Compliance-safe messaging:** "tokenized assets," "non-custodial wallet," "agentic finance" — never
  "deposits," "FDIC," "bank account," or investment-return promises. Every investment surface carries
  the "not advice / not an offering" disclaimer the product already models.
- **Content & community:** build in public on the agent/MCP + DID/VC tech; developer-credible
  content earns the early crypto/AI crowd. Position the MCP server as a platform third parties can
  build on.
- **Narrative:** "the first bank run by AI agents — that you actually control." Differentiation, not
  feature parity.

## 9. Tech gaps to close (additive checklist)

| # | Gap | Priority | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **KMS / HSM for server-held keys** | ⚠ Stage 1 | The documented `private_key_hex` gap; treasury multisig |
| 2 | **On-chain ↔ ledger reconciliation** | Stage 1 | The deferred invariant `n`; powers the reconciliation agent (§3) |
| 3 | **Data warehouse + analytics** | Stage 1 | BigQuery/Redshift; product + risk analytics |
| 4 | **Feature store** | Stage 1 | Underpins §5 fraud ML (Feast or managed) |
| 5 | **Model registry + monitoring** | Stage 1 | Versioning, drift, explainability for fraud models |
| 6 | **Incident response + on-call** | Stage 0→1 | Runbooks, paging, status comms |
| 7 | **SOC 2 readiness automation** | Phase B | Vanta/Drata; partners will require SOC 2 Type II |
| 8 | **Public status page** | Stage 0 | Trust signal; ~free |
| 9 | **WAF / DDoS / bot defense** | Stage 0 | Cloudflare in front (already in the stack) |
| 10 | **Secrets rotation + key ceremony** | Stage 1 | Especially the Hedera treasury keys |
| 11 | **Dedicated staging env** | Stage 0 | Mirror of prod; the E2E suite already targets it |
| 12 | **Rate-limit hardening at the edge** | Stage 0 | The app limiter exists; add edge limits too |
| 13 | **Backup restore drills** | Stage 1 | Test DR quarterly, not just configure it |

---

## 10. Phased production roadmap (aligned to the compliance ramp)

| | **Stage 0 — Lean launch** | **Stage 1 — Scale** | **Stage 2 — Licensed** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Compliance phase (Corp doc) | A (non-custodial) | B (partnered, MSB) | C (own licenses) |
| Cloud | Render/Fly + Neon + Aura | AWS (or GCP) single VPC | Multi-AZ HA, audited |
| Keys | On-device + Infisical | **KMS/HSM + treasury multisig** | HSM key ceremonies |
| Agents | Onboarding-risk live; MCP external | + reconciliation, compliance-triage, treasury | Full AI-ops with regulator-grade audit |
| Fraud | Rules + graph (in-house) | + ML anomaly + AML vendor | Tuned models + case management |
| Identity Vault | Neo4j Aura, core schema | Graph features into fraud model | Regulator-facing link analysis |
| Mobile | **iOS** (verify Xcode build) | + Android | Both, hardened |
| Evidence | Append-only triggers + KMS | Evaluate Constellation | Constellation if a partner needs it |
| Compliance tooling | ToS/AML policy + OFAC | SOC 2 (Vanta/Drata) | Exams, MTL/transfer-agent |

**The throughline:** every stage spends only what the prior stage's traction earns. You launch on
~$100/mo of PaaS as a non-custodial software product; you bring KMS, ML fraud, a second mobile
platform, and SOC 2 only when partners and scale require them; and you reserve the expensive
hyperscaler + licensing posture for when revenue justifies it — the same lean-now / hardened-later
logic that drives the corporate structure.
