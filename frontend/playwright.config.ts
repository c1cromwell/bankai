/**
 * Argus Financial Partners web E2E (browser-driven). Closes the gap the validation runbook flags:
 * "UI smoke is manual until a browser-driver is added" (docs/E2E-VALIDATION.md §2).
 *
 * Drives the real React portal in Chromium against a real backend on :3001.
 * `globalSetup` seeds the dev DB directly (the seed scripts talk to SQLite, not
 * HTTP) BEFORE the web servers boot, so both servers come up already-seeded.
 *
 * Auth: dev `ALLOW_PASSWORD_AUTH=true` lets read-only journeys log in as the
 * seeded demo users; the passkey journey uses a CDP virtual authenticator
 * (RP_ID defaults to `localhost`, matching the :5173 origin).
