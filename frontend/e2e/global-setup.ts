 * Seed the dev DB before the web servers boot.

 * `npm run setup` is idempotent: migrate + RBAC admin (admin@argusfinancial.com /
 * Admin1234!) + simulator MCP client + the five demo users (*@demo.com /
 * Demo1234!). `seed:marketplace` adds the Invest/Collect listings the portal
 * renders. Both talk to SQLite directly — no server needed yet.
 *
 * These scripts only ever create-if-absent, so re-running across test runs is
 * safe; tests that mutate state register their own throwaway users instead of
 * touching the demo accounts.
