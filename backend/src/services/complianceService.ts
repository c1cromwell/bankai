/**
 * Phase 8 — Compliance Module + Identity Registry (in-app model of ERC-3643).
 *
 * For SECURITIES (erc3643 / kind === "security") a holding/transfer is permitted
 * only if the recipient:
 *   - is on the Identity Registry (has an identity profile),
 *   - meets the asset's minimum tier,
 *   - is in an allowed jurisdiction, and
 *   - would not push the asset over its holder-count cap (§12(g) style).
 * Non-securities (HTS collectibles/gaming) transfer freely between Argus Financial Partners users
 * (subject only to the asset's min_tier, if any).
 *
 * A deployed, audited ERC-3643 contract enforcing these on-chain is the
 * production item; this service is the prototype's faithful stand-in.
