/**
 * Stage 1 fraud seam — in-process, prototype-scale fraud screening of the money path.
 *
 * This is the deliberately small first slice of docs/business/FraudEngine.md, shaped
 * so it grows into the streaming target without rework:
 *
 *   RiskEvent  → scoreTransfer (deterministic rules)  → FraudDecision (score+action)
 *              → record to append-only fraud_decisions ("audit topic" analog)
 *              → enforce (block throws FRAUD_BLOCKED)
 *
 * Invariant (mirrors onboarding's assessRisk→finalizeDecision): the score is ADVISORY;
 * the deterministic thresholds here are the only thing that blocks. When a real
 * Transformer model lands, it replaces scoreTransfer and feeds the same decision/
 * enforcement/audit contract — model_version moves off 'rules-v0'.
 *
 * The scorer reads only derived facts from the existing `transactions` ledger view
 * (velocity, trailing max, prior-payee), never raw PII.
